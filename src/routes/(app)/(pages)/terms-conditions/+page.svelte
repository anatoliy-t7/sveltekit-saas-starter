				<strong><strong><strong><strong>15.</strong></strong>&nbsp;</strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong>
			</div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div>
				These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of France, and the use
				of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sales of Goods is
				expressly excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you
				additionally possess the protection provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law in
				your country to residence. localhost and yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive
				jurisdiction of the courts of TEST, which means that you may make a claim to defend your
				consumer protection rights in regards to these Legal Terms in France, or in the EU country
				in which you reside.

			</div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div><strong>Informal Negotiations</strong></div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div>
				To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to
				these Legal Terms (each a 'Dispute' and collectively, the 'Disputes') brought by either you
				or us (individually, a 'Party' and collectively, the 'Parties'), the Parties agree to first
				attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally
				for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations
				commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
			</div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong></div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div>
				Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these Legal Terms shall be
				determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with the Arbitration and
				Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration being part of the European Centre of
				Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the
				application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes
				acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Tulouse, France. The language of the
				proceedings shall be English. Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of
				France.
			</div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div><strong>Restrictions</strong></div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div>
				The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
				individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with
				any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on
				a class-action basis or to utilise class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
				authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
				the general public or any other persons.
			</div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div><strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</strong></div>
			<div><br /></div>
			<div>
				The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
				concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or
				protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party;
				(b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
				privacy, or unauthorised use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is
				found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
				falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
				Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
				jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
				court.

				These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in
				respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and
				us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not

				venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
				result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will
